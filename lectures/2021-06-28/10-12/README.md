# Data science for neuroscience

(Or, "Project and data management: tips for the ~~lazy~~ industrious researcher")

This session will provide an overview of project + data management techniques + tools, with a focus on community-based standards.
There will be a practical demonstration of how to use [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/) to set up a project and a quick overview of how to use git/GitHub for version control.

## Requirements

You will need to have git installed on your local computer and a GitHub account in order to follow along with the demonstration!
(Also, to use these principles in the future, it's recommended you have a basic Python installation with at least cookiecutter installed.
Check the main README in the root of this repository for installation instructions!
